# 02.push_swap
sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions

###### Structure  
```
For this program, getting more accostumed with doubly linked lists, personally was the way to go.   
1. Faster push + pops   
2. If a second object would hold a * pointer to (i called them flags) the head, tail, bigger, and smaller etc,   would also facilitate peek, and overall improve speed as operation decrease.   
```
###### Approach  
```
It's not implemented yet, but my idea is to divide into stack_a && stack_b even and uneven numbers.    
Then sort them in multy-thread, and join stack_b into stack_a by ultiple swaps.  
I'll post here how that went.
